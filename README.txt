Self-study notes run in MIT-Scheme(*.scm).

Exercises in the SCIP textbook are tried and saved for further review purposes.

It is too long to scoll up and down for editing,
so truncated for the first two chapters.

 wc sicp_notes.scm 
 1647  5114 33945 sicp_notes.scm

And the rest of chapters has to be finished and uploaded later.
